## To run this program

No third-party library installations are required to run this program. Everything contained within the program is part of the Python standard library.

The program is run through a main `word_finder.py` file. To run the program type `python word_finder.py` from within the folder and start answering the prompts. Soon you, and your friends if using multi-player, will have a list of suggested words to help you win every game.

## To run tests

There are two test files for the two classes to check that their methods work as expected. To run the test using `unittest`, type the command `python -m unittest test_WordScores.py` or `python -m unittest test_ScrabbleWords.py`.
